This is a challenging task for LLMs, and it is difficult to evaluate whether the model is using the context correctly. \n",

    "Langchain has a handy `ContextQAEvalChain` class that allows you to evaluate your RAG models. It takes a `context` and a `question` as well as a `prediction` and a `reference` to evaluate the correctness of the generation. The evaluator returns a dictionary with the following values:\n",
